    Believed to be a descendent of ancient Egyptian's cats, it has big ears and
    tawny, short-haired fur. They're very loyal companians that attach
    themselves to their owners, having a playful and energetic disposition.

    like they aren't getting enough of your attention, so it's important to
    consider how much time you would have for them before adopting.<br />
